Topic,Formula
CSMA/CD Minimum Frame Size,Minimum Frame Size (bits) = 2 × Propagation Time × Bandwidth
,Propagation Time = Distance / Propagation Speed
Pure ALOHA Throughput,"S = G × e^(-2G), Maximum at G=0.5, Smax = 0.184 (18.4%)"
Slotted ALOHA Throughput,"S = G × e^(-G), Maximum at G=1, Smax = 0.368 (36.8%)"
Hamming Code Parity Bits,"2^r ≥ m + r + 1, where m=data bits, r=parity bits"
Subnetting - Number of Subnets,"Number of subnets = 2^n, where n = borrowed bits"
Subnetting - Hosts per Subnet,"Hosts per subnet = 2^h - 2, where h = host bits"
Efficiency of Stop-and-Wait,"Efficiency = 1 / (1 + 2a), where a = Tp/Tt"
Propagation Time,Tp = Distance / Propagation Speed
Transmission Time,Tt = Frame Size / Bandwidth
Bandwidth-Delay Product,BDP = Bandwidth × Round Trip Time
TCP Window Size,Window Size ≥ Bandwidth × RTT
